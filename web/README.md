This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Environment variables

Key variables consumed by the app (set these in `.env.local` for local dev and in your hosting platform for production):

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` — Supabase project URL (public).
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — Supabase anon key (public).
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — Supabase **service role key**. Server-only; never expose to the client. Used exclusively by admin-only API routes (`/api/admin/*`) to list users and view everyone's time data.
- `ADMIN_EMAILS` — comma-separated list of emails granted the Admin module. Example: `ADMIN_EMAILS=you@flyability.com,ops@flyability.com`. Only users signed in with one of these emails see the Admin tab and can call `/api/admin/*`. Compared case-insensitively.
- Google Sheets variables (`GOOGLE_SHEETS_*`) — travel-sheet integration for the Time Tracker.
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com). **Server-only.** Used by the mail **Brief mode** (`/api/generate-brief`) to have Claude write a training email from a free-text brief. Referenced only from `src/lib/mail-brief-llm.ts` (`"server-only"`). Pay-as-you-go; a single email costs a few cents. If unset, Brief mode returns an error but the structured "Guided" generator (`/api/generate`) still works.
- `MAIL_BRIEF_MODEL` — optional **fallback** for the Brief-mode model. The model is normally chosen in the dashboard (Admin → Mail & AI → "Mail brief model", stored in `workspace_settings.mail_brief_model`). This env var only applies when that setting is unset; if neither is set the default is `claude-opus-4-8`. Allowed values: `claude-opus-4-8` or `claude-sonnet-5`.
- `RESEND_API_KEY` — API key from [Resend](https://resend.com/api-keys). Used by the weekly "log your time" reminder email job.
- `RESEND_FROM` — verified sender identity used for reminder emails, currently `Flya Allrounder <noreply@flya.space>`. The domain must be verified in Resend first (`flya.space`, EU/Ireland region).
- `RESEND_REPLY_TO` — optional `Reply-To` header for reminder emails (e.g. an HR mailbox).
- `CRON_SECRET` — any long random string. Vercel automatically sends it as `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>` when it triggers Cron endpoints, and our reminder route rejects calls that don't match.
- `APP_BASE_URL` — optional. Overrides the dashboard link embedded in reminder emails. Defaults to the request origin. Set to `https://flya.space` in production.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` — public origin used to build the `/r/<id>` click-tracking links embedded in **outbound customer email**, and to absolutise image URLs in email HTML. Currently `https://flya.space`. Resolution order is `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` → `VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL` → request origin (`src/lib/email/link-tracker.ts`). Set it explicitly: relying on the fallbacks means the hostname baked into already-sent emails is decided by deployment state rather than by you. Because it is `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` it is compiled in at build time — changing it requires a redeploy, not just an env save. Never point it at a preview deployment URL; those links must outlive the deployment. See `docs/domain-change-runbook.md`.

Security note: the service role key bypasses Row-Level Security. It is only referenced from `src/lib/supabase/admin.ts`, which is marked `"server-only"` and is called solely after the `guardAdmin()` / `guardTimeViewer()` check in `src/lib/admin-guard.ts`.

### Roles

Roles are stored in Supabase `user_metadata.role`:

- `sales`, `eu_pilot`, `us_pilot` — self-selectable on first login.
- `hr` — read-only access to the **Team time** tab (aggregated weekly summaries + per-user week drill-down). HR cannot see or manage user roles. Not self-selectable; only an admin (email listed in `ADMIN_EMAILS`) can assign it via the Admin → Users &amp; roles tab.

The `hr` role re-uses the admin time endpoints (`/api/admin/time-overview` and `/api/admin/time-user`) via `guardTimeViewer()`. Role management (`/api/admin/users`) remains gated behind `guardAdmin()`.

### Weekly "log your time" reminder

A Vercel Cron Job hits `GET /api/cron/time-log-reminder` every Monday at 07:00 UTC **and** 08:00 UTC (configured in `vercel.json`). The route internally gates on "weekday = Monday AND hour = 9 in Europe/Zurich", so exactly one of the two invocations does work year-round — regardless of CET/CEST daylight-savings shifts.

For each user whose `user_metadata.role` is `sales`, `eu_pilot`, or `us_pilot`, the route sums `time_day_logs.net_mins` across the previous Monday→Sunday window. If the total is **0 minutes**, a reminder email is sent via [Resend](https://resend.com).

Useful knobs (all admin-gated unless called with the cron secret):

- **Preview the email in your browser:** `GET /api/cron/time-log-reminder?preview=html` renders the exact HTML recipients will see. Add `&name=Sarah` to override the greeting. `preview=text` returns the plain-text variant.
- **Send a test email to yourself:** `GET /api/cron/time-log-reminder?send_test=you@example.com` sends one real email to the given address via Resend, subject-prefixed with `[TEST]`. Does not touch the normal candidate list.
- **Dry run:** `GET /api/cron/time-log-reminder?dry=1&force=1` lists the candidates and what would be sent, without actually sending.
- **Send now regardless of time:** `GET /api/cron/time-log-reminder?force=1` (**actually sends** to every candidate — use carefully).
- **Vercel Cron auth:** When `CRON_SECRET` is set, Vercel sends it as `Authorization: Bearer <secret>` and the route trusts the call without requiring an admin session. If `CRON_SECRET` is missing, only admin-authed requests go through.

Tables involved:

- `time_day_logs` — summed via the service-role key to decide who gets reminded.
- `time_log_reminder_sends` — per-send audit log written by the cron route. One row is inserted for every outcome (`sent`, `failed`, `skipped_dry_run`), capturing the user, target week, Resend message id (or error), whether the call came from Vercel Cron or an admin session, and whether `force`/`dry` were used. See `supabase/2026-04-17-time-log-reminder-send-log.sql` for the schema; the table is RLS-locked and only the service-role key writes to it.

### Fleet (beta)

Material tracking and day-level booking for drones, range extenders, ground stations and shared accessories — the replacement for the "Fleet management" Google Sheet. Reached from the burger menu ("Fleet", beta-badged); available to every signed-in user.

- **Schema (run in order):** `supabase/2026-09-01-fleet-management.sql`, then `-fleet-holder-claims.sql`, `-fleet-assigned-pool.sql`, `-fleet-remove-us-material.sql`, then `-fleet-emea-inventory.sql`, `-fleet-roadshow-bookings.sql`, and finally `-fleet-nicknames-and-name-merge.sql`.
- **Inventory:** `2026-09-01-fleet-emea-inventory.sql` is the authoritative list — the 31-item EMEA fleet (drones, LiDAR Rev 7, RAD / UT / LEL payloads, dummy drones, tethers). It is a **full replacement**: it empties the tables and rebuilds, so re-running it discards bookings made in the app. The units seeded by the first migration were the wrong fleet (global Elios 3 stock, much of it retired, customer-owned or American) and had none of the payloads, which is why the old booking calendar referenced equipment that did not exist here. Applied by hand like the other migrations. Creates `fleet_assets`, `fleet_reservations`, `fleet_asset_events`, `fleet_reminder_sends`, and seeds the live Elios 3 fleet from the sheet. Safe to re-run. Requires the `btree_gist` extension (the migration creates it) for the day-overlap exclusion constraint, which is what actually prevents two people holding one asset on the same day under concurrent requests.
- **Pool vs. assigned:** `fleet_assets.pooled` splits the fleet. Pooled units are shared and appear in the booking calendar; the rest are assigned to a person, region or customer and live in the **Assigned** tab instead. This is a property of the asset, not of a booking — it answers "does the team share this unit?", which does not change when one booking ends. `isBookable()` in `lib/fleet-rules.ts` is the single definition used by both the server query and the client filter: pooled, and not retired or in repair. Move units with the `assign` / `return_to_pool` actions. The backfill marks everything the sheet had as `out` (22 of 41) as assigned.
- **Roadshow bookings:** `2026-09-01-fleet-roadshow-bookings.sql` carries the 2026 bookings from the "Roadshow planing 2025" planning grid — 57 bookings, Jan–Apr 2026, 8 assets, 9 people. Reconstructed from the PDF export: each booking is a merged coloured cell, so its edges give the exact span, and the person is the row block it sits in. Two checks guard the column-to-date mapping — all 730 day columns match the day number printed above them, and the sheet's own vertical "NEW YEAR" marker lands on 31 Dec / 1 Jan. The grid has a narrow separator column carrying no day number, so interpolating an average column pitch drifts by weeks; always look up the real column positions.
- **Holder names are full names.** The availability table wrote first names ("Emil"), the roadshow calendar wrote full names ("Emil Wallnofer"); the short form is folded into the long one by `-fleet-nicknames-and-name-merge.sql`. Leaving both would offer each person two names to claim, and claiming one would not claim the other — the alias key is the normalised label.
- **Booking model:** a reservation is an inclusive run of calendar **days** (`start_date`/`end_date`); `end_date` *is* the due date, and a one-day booking has `start_date = end_date`. Days rather than weeks because most missions run two or three days — booking by the week blocked a unit Monday-to-Sunday for a Tuesday job, so the board looked full while the shelf was not. Clicking a free cell in the calendar starts a selection, clicking a second cell in the same row extends it. Max 84 days, enforced in both the app and a check constraint.
- **History in the calendar:** completed (`returned`) bookings render as muted cells with the holder's name, so "who had this in March" is answerable by scrolling back. Live bookings win a shared day — a returned booking no longer holds the asset and must never hide the one that does. A date picker beside the stepper jumps to any period; stepping 14 days at a time made older history effectively unreachable.
- **Locations:** each asset carries its `current_location` plus `location_confirmed_at`. Anything unconfirmed for more than 42 days renders as "Unconfirmed" so it gets chased. Every movement appends a row to `fleet_asset_events`.
- **Reliability score:** derived (never stored) from a user's reservation history by `src/lib/fleet-rules.ts`. Starts at 100, +2 per on-time return, minus a penalty for late returns and a larger, growing one for material still out past its due date; a user with no history is provisional at 75. Tiers set the booking horizon in days — Trusted (85+) 84, Standard (60+) 56, Watch (35+) 28, Restricted 7 — and order the waitlist when two people want the same days. Admins bypass the horizon.
- **Calendar window:** `GET /api/fleet?start=<YYYY-MM-DD>&days=<n>` (defaults to today + 28 days; `days` is clamped to 7–92 because the grid renders one column per day).
- **Automatic name matching:** every board load, until the user has an alias, `autoLinkHolder()` tries to match them to a legacy holder name — so a returning user *and* a brand-new signup are matched without a separate auth hook. It matches on a shared **first or last** name in either position (`holderLabelMatchesPerson`; middles and sub-3-character tokens ignored), and links **only when exactly one** unclaimed name matches. That guard is what makes the loose matching safe: two colleagues called Philipp both match "Philipp", so neither is linked and both are asked. Candidates come from reservations **and** asset holders — someone can hold assigned kit without ever appearing in a booking. The result is announced in the UI rather than applied silently.
- **Identity setup (once per person):** when no automatic match is found, Fleet asks "is *X* you?" for the name that best matches. Yes claims it; No opens the full list of unclaimed names; "I'm not on the list" registers them under their own name via `register_member`. Gated on `identity_confirmed` — whether the user has any row in `fleet_holder_aliases` — so it is asked once per **person**, not once per browser, and survives clearing localStorage or switching device. Admins see the outstanding names as a quick list in the Manage tab.
- **Unclaimed holders:** the sheet recorded who has a unit as free text ("Wataru", "APAC team"), so a reservation may carry `holder_label` with a null `user_id`. Those bookings hold the asset on the calendar but belong to nobody: they mail no one (no address) and score no one. When that person signs in, the Fleet panel offers them the name and `claim_holder` transfers every booking under it. Any name **nobody has claimed yet** can be claimed by anyone: the sheet spelled people inconsistently, and a strict name match would strand exactly the people this flow exists to onboard. A name already mapped to someone else is refused for non-admins — that would hand over a colleague's material and history. Every claim writes an audit event naming the claimant and flags it when the name does not match them, so a wrong pick is visible and reversible rather than prevented. Claims are remembered in `fleet_holder_aliases`.
- **Imported bookings** carry `source = 'sheet_import'` and are **excluded from the reliability score**. Their due dates are guesses made by a migration; penalising someone for one would make the score arbitrary on day one. They still block the calendar and check in normally.
- **Reminders ship OFF.** `fleet_settings.reminders_enabled` defaults to false and the cron returns `skipped: "reminders_disabled"`. An admin turns it on from the Fleet panel, or `POST /api/fleet {action:"set_reminders",enabled:true}`. `?preview=` still renders while paused.
- **Manage tab (admins only):** add, edit and remove material from the fleet, plus restore anything removed. Removal is **soft** (`active = false`): every read path filters on `active`, so the unit leaves the calendar, the lists and the reminders while its rows, movement history and bookings survive — and it can be restored from the same screen. A hard delete would cascade the history away, and "this left the fleet" is not "this never existed". Archiving also cancels any live booking against the unit, which would otherwise sit in someone's list with no way to check it in.
- **Writes:** `POST /api/fleet` only. `fleet_assets`/`fleet_reservations` grant no INSERT/UPDATE to `authenticated`, because the horizon, queue order and "whose booking is this" checks cannot be expressed as RLS. Actions: `reserve`, `cancel`, `check_out`, `check_in`, `move`, `confirm_location`, `claim_holder`, `assign`, `return_to_pool`, and the admin-only `set_status`, `set_reminders`, `create_asset`, `update_asset`, `archive_asset`; plus `register_member` for anyone not in the sheet.
- **Reminders:** `GET /api/cron/fleet-return-reminder`, daily at 06:00 UTC via `vercel.json`. Mails the holder the day before the due date, on the due date, then daily for a week and every third day after that. `fleet_reminder_sends` has a unique index on (reservation, kind, date), and the row is claimed *before* the send, so a retry or double cron fire cannot double-mail. Same auth as the time-log reminder (`CRON_SECRET` bearer or an admin session) and the same helpers: `?preview=html|text`, `?send_test=<email>`, `?dry=1`.
- **Before the migration is applied:** outside production only, `GET /api/fleet` detects the missing tables and returns a labelled sample board (`demo: true`) so the UI can be reviewed; the panel shows a banner and blocks writes. Never served in production, and never when the tables exist.

### Team Chat

A floating "Team chat" pill at the bottom-right of the dashboard opens a slide-in panel where every signed-in user can chat in a single global channel.

- **Schema (run in order):**
  1. `supabase/2026-04-19-team-chat.sql` — creates `public.chat_messages`, RLS policies, the realtime publication entry, and the private `chat-attachments` Storage bucket.
  2. `supabase/2026-04-19-team-chat-marks-and-votes.sql` — adds `kind` / `done_at` / `done_by` / `edited_at` columns, owner-only UPDATE/DELETE policies (column-level grant restricts authors to editing `body` only), the `chat_message_votes` table with its RLS, and sets `replica identity full` on both tables so Realtime delivers full UPDATE/DELETE rows.
  3. `supabase/2026-08-07-chat-certificate-request.sql` — widens the `kind` check constraint with `certificate_request`.
- **Realtime requirement:** the dashboard subscribes to `postgres_changes` on both `chat_messages` and `chat_message_votes`, so Realtime must be enabled for the project (default on Supabase).
- **Attachments:** files (≤10 MB) are uploaded directly from the browser to the `chat-attachments` bucket under a per-user folder (`<user_id>/...`). Recipients fetch them via 1-hour signed URLs generated client-side with the user's JWT.
- **Presence + typing:** ephemeral, sent over Supabase Realtime presence/broadcast channels — no DB writes.
- **Message kinds & filters:** a message can be tagged on send as a `feature_request` or a `best_practice`, and the composer's fourth slot opens the certificate-request form (below). The widget exposes filter chips that, for the request kinds, hide entries that have been marked done. `change_request` is **retired** — the composer can't produce it and it has no filter chip, but the kind is still accepted by the DB constraint and still renders its badge so the requests already in the history are unaffected.
- **Certificate requests:** "Certificate" in the composer opens a modal (customer account name, participants with names + emails, training date, Intro/AIIM, training location Flya HQ / customer account). The trainer is not an input — it is derived from the session. `POST /api/chat/certificate-request` (any signed-in user, rate-limited to 20/h per user+IP) renders a copy-ready summary, writes it as a `certificate_request` chat message with the service-role client, and mails that summary to every address in `ADMIN_EMAILS` via Resend. Mail delivery is best-effort: if Resend fails or is unconfigured, the request is still saved and the response reports `notified: false`. Formatting lives in `src/lib/certificate-request.ts` and is shared by the route and the modal so the chat body and the email can't drift.
- **Votes:** any signed-in user may upvote or downvote `feature_request` (and legacy `change_request`) messages (one vote each, toggleable). `best_practice` and `certificate_request` messages do not have voting.
- **Marking done:** only admins (emails listed in `ADMIN_EMAILS`) see the "Mark done" button, on feature requests, certificate requests, and legacy change requests. The flip happens via `POST /api/chat/mark-done`, which is `guardAdmin()`-protected and uses the service-role key to write `done_at` / `done_by`. RLS deliberately doesn't allow ordinary users to update those columns even on their own messages (column-level UPDATE grant restricts authors to `body` + `edited_at`).
- **Edit / delete:** authors can edit their own message's text or delete it entirely. Edits set `edited_at` and the row gets an "(edited)" tag; deletes are hard deletes (cascades through votes).
- **No new env vars.** Uses the existing `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, the existing `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` + `ADMIN_EMAILS` (for `mark-done` and certificate requests), and the existing `RESEND_API_KEY` / `RESEND_FROM` for the certificate-request notification.
