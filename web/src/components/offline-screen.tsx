 * The offline page: the game, and a way back once the connection returns.
 *
 * It does not reload on its own when the browser comes back online — that
 * would throw away a run in progress. It offers instead.
 *
 * `leaderboard` is on even though there is no network: the board simply fails
 * to load, a finished run is queued in localStorage, and both catch up the
 * moment the browser reports it is online again.
 *
 * The server snapshot is "offline", unlike everywhere else: the service worker
 * caches this page's HTML while the browser is online, but only ever shows it
 * when it is not, so the server-rendered first frame should say so.
