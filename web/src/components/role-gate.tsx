/**
 * The holding screen a signed-in account sees while it has no role.
 *
 * Roles are written by exactly one place — the guardAdmin()-protected
 * PATCH /api/admin/users — so there is nothing useful for the user to do here
 * and nothing to click except sign out. This replaced a first-login picker that
 * let people choose their own profile; that write landed in `user_metadata`,
 * which the user can rewrite themselves, and no reader ever looked there.
 *
 * It is a server component rendered INSTEAD of the dashboard shell, not an
 * overlay on top of it: no module code is sent, no panel is mounted and no
 * prefetch runs, so there is nothing to reach behind it. `RoleGateGame` is the
 * one client component here, and it is deliberately inert — no fetch, no
 * Supabase, no session props — so the gate still exposes nothing.
 *
 * The tone is deliberately light. This is somebody's first ever screen in the
 * app and nothing is wrong — they are waiting on a colleague, not looking at an
 * error, so it should not read like a permissions failure.
