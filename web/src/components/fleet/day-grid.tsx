/**
 * The booking calendar: one row per asset, one cell per DAY.
 *
 * Clicking a free cell starts a selection; clicking a second cell in the same
 * row extends it — that is the whole booking gesture. Occupied cells show who
 * has the material, so "where is it on the 14th" is answerable at a glance,
 * which the merged-cell spreadsheet grid never managed.
 *
 * Days rather than weeks because most missions are two or three days long.
 * Booking by the week meant a Tuesday–Wednesday job blocked the unit from
 * Monday to Sunday, so the board looked full while the shelf was not.
 *
 * ## Why this file is shaped for re-rendering
 *
 * The grid is the biggest thing on the screen — roughly 400 cells — and it sits
 * under state that changes constantly: a keystroke in the search box, a click in
 * the calendar. Two rules keep that cheap, and both are easy to undo by
 * accident:
 *
 *  1. **Per-day facts are computed once per window**, by `describeDays`, not per
 *     cell. Anything that depends only on the day belongs in `DayMeta`.
 *  2. **Each row is a memoised component** that only sees its own slice of the
 *     selection, so selecting days in one row does not re-render the others.
 *     This works only while the callbacks from the parent are stable — they are
 *     `useState` setters today. Passing an inline arrow instead would silently
 *     make every row re-render again.
