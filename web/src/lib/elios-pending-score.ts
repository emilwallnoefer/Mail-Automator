/**
 * Rules for a leaderboard score that could not be posted yet.
 *
 * A run flown offline — on the offline page, or in the dashboard after the
 * connection dropped — still counts. Its score is kept in localStorage and
 * posted the next time the app is online. Pure: no storage, no fetch; the I/O
 * lives in `lib/elios-score-sync.ts`.
 *
 * Only ONE pending score is ever kept, the highest. The board records a
 * player's best and refuses anything that is not an improvement, so posting
 * every offline crash would change nothing but the request count.
