/**
 * Fleet module — pure business rules.
 *
 * Everything in here is deliberately free of Supabase, Next, and `Date.now()`
 * (callers pass `today`), so the reservation calendar, the reliability score and
 * the reminder cron all agree on one implementation and can be unit-tested.
 *
 * The three ideas the module is built around:
 *
 *  1. **Days.** A booking is an inclusive run of calendar days — pick it up
 *     Tuesday, back Thursday. Missions rarely line up with Monday-to-Sunday,
 *     and rounding a two-day job up to a whole week made the old sheet look
 *     fully booked while half the fleet sat on a shelf.
 *  2. **Every asset has one current location**, and every movement writes an
 *     event. "Where is it" is answered by the asset row; "how did it get there"
 *     by its event history.
 *  3. **Reliability score.** Bringing material back on time earns trust; not
 *     bringing it back costs it. The score sets how far ahead you may book and
 *     where you land in the queue for a contested day, so the person who never
 *     returns anything is last in line, automatically.

 * its "Emil Wallnofer". That looseness is deliberate and necessary: the sheet
 * spells people inconsistently, and requiring the whole name to line up would
 * strand exactly the people this exists to onboard.
 *
 * The safeguard against a loose match is NOT here — it is at the call site,
 * which auto-links only when exactly ONE unclaimed name matches. Two colleagues
 * called Philipp both match "Philipp", so neither is linked automatically and
 * the person is asked instead.
 *
 * The email local part is used as a fallback identity when the account has no
 * display name ("emil.wallnofer@" -> emil / wallnofer).
