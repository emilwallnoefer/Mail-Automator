 * Puts an assigned unit back into the shared pool: it becomes bookable and
 * reappears in the calendar. Closes whatever open booking was holding it.
 *
 * Admin only, as the mirror of `assign`. Without the guard any signed-in user
 * could name any asset and force-close someone else's live booking — and a
 * booking closed as `returned` past its due date is scored as a late return, so
 * an open endpoint here is also a way to damage another person's reliability.
