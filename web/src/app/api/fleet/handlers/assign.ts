/**
 * Takes a unit out of the shared pool and assigns it to someone.
 *
 * Used for the units that are not really shared — a regional demo drone, a
 * customer loan, a unit that lives with one person. It leaves the calendar
 * (nobody can book it) and moves to the Assigned tab.
 *
 * The holder is free text on purpose: the person may have no account, which is
 * exactly the situation the sheet was in. It is recorded as an open booking so
 * the unit still has a check-in path and can be claimed later.
 *
 * Admin only, for the same reason `set_status` is: this takes material off the
 * calendar for everyone and cancels whatever was booked on it. It is reachable
 * only from Fleet -> Manage, which is already an admin-only surface.
